				<p>Second year students have the opportunity to do an abroad internship, during the fourth semester. first year DUT students have the possibility to apply for an abroad internship in june, and professional degree students can apply for an abroad internship in september.

			<p class="TitleHead">What are the advantages of an abroad internship ?</p>
			
				<h2>Learn or improve a language</h2>
			
					<p>Study abroad is the best way to learn a foreign language. In fact, you will be able to speak more fluently, by speaking all the day with natives speakers. You will also be able to develop your technical language proper to your domain. It is a very important asset for the recruitments consultants. By the way, you will be able to make friends easier in the country.</p>
			 <hr>
				<h2>Discover a new culture</h2>
			
					<p>Living abroad for a few month will allow you to discover a new culture and open you mind to something you probably never met before. It is an important experience that everyone should live in his life.</p>
        <hr>
				<h2>Learn to be independant</h2>

					<p>This experience will make you take your own responsibilities and gain maturity. You will also be able to open your eyes about how the real world looks like.</p>
        <hr>
				<h2>A different way to learn</h2>

					<p>Abroad, we are learning differently. You will be able to learn a different way of learning and working, and who knows, maybe you will find your way through this experience.</p>
        <hr>
				<h2>Add value to your CV</h2>
			
					<p>Obviously, having an abroad experience can only be a good point on a cv. This could be a reason for the employer to choose, and no one else. You will show to the employer that you are open-minded and able to adapt to other environments.</p>
			   <hr>
            <p class="TitleHead">How to finance this experience ?</p>

				<p>Planning to live abroad is very expensive, you have to pay for all the papers you will need as the passport, the visa; the plane ticket, and you will also have to think about the life's price on site. The price vary according to the country where you pass your internship. But don't worry ! There are a few financial assistances. <a href="http://www.univ-artois.fr/International/Etudier-a-l-etranger/Financements/Financements-et-criteres-d-eligibilite">Here</a> you can find the eligibilities requierments 
				and <a href="http://www.univ-artois.fr/International/Etudier-a-l-etranger/Financements/Procedure-de-demande-de-financements">here</a> are the procedures to follow to ask for a financing.</p>
			<hr>
			<p class="TitleHead">How to prepare your stay ?</p>
			
				<p>A stay is considered as well prepared when you don't have anything more to think about when you leave. This is why you have to prepare all the clothes you will need, your phone, your computer...
				you should also think about the distinctive characteristics of the country where you will stay. for example, in england, you need specific plugs to connect your electronical equipments. You should also think about 
				a new mobile package, if possible, an international mobile package, because you may need to call your friends or your family. Try not to take too many things in your suitcase: think about the space you will have on site.
				<p>Still not convinced ? Need more informations ? Just check a <a href="temoignage.html">student's record</a> or this video to complete all the informations we gave you just before, and know how to prepare a good travel abroad.</p>
